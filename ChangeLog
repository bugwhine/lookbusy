1.0: initial release.

1.1: Various fixes:

  + Some tidying and culling of verbose output

  + CPU usage self-adjustment was usually wrong on multi-core machines, where
    more than one CPU-jiffy may elapse per wallclock-jiffy.  Fixed to account
    for the number of detected CPUs, or --ncpus if given.

  + The CPU spinner's busy-wait loop was able to be optimized out on newer
    GCC builds, and seemingly even by more recent x86_64 CPUs.  Adjusted the
    busy-waits to be less optimizable at the cost of some memory bus traffic.

  + If any child processes die, be more explicit about their exit status

  + Get HZ (used to compute jiffies/sec) from sysconf()

  + Get VM page size from sysconf()

  + Fix compilation warnings on x86_64

1.2: Two fixes:

  + CPU adjustments were not being properly retained across iterations, so
    a verbose-level check identifying when proper sleep calibration had been
    reached was never actually displayed; this did not affect proper
    function.

  + Fix compilation under Debian Etch.

1.3: One fix:

  + Desired on-disk size was not being correctly passed to the disk stirrer
    process, causing errors on little-endian systems with LFS support.

1.4: One fix:

  + Memory stirs greater than 4GB should work now, after fixes to non 64-bit
    clean codepath.
  + v1.3 did not properly identify itself as such with --version
